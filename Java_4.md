Earlier in this chapter I stated that the **comma** operator (not the
comma separator, which is used to separate definitions and method
arguments) has only one use in Java: in the control expression of a for
loop

 

You can also control the flow of the loop inside the body of any of the
iteration statements by using break and continue. break quits the loop
without executing the rest of the statements in the loop. continue stops
the execution of the current iteration and goes back to the beginning of
the loop to begin the next iteration
